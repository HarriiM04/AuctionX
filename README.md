## Application Architecture and Flow

### Overview

AuctionX follows a clean **MVC architecture** with distinct separation of concerns:

* **Models:** Represent data entities like Players, Teams, Tournaments, Bids, and Users.
* **Views:** Razor views render responsive UI components for auction rooms, player lists, team creation, and bidding interfaces.
* **Controllers:** Handle HTTP requests, enforce business logic, and manage role-based access control.

### Real-Time Communication

* **SignalR Hub:**
  Acts as the central communication channel for broadcasting live auction events:

  * New bids placed by bidders
  * Auction status changes (start, pause, finalize) initiated by organizers
  * Player SOLD/UNSOLD status updates

* **Client Interaction:**
  Connected clients receive push notifications in real-time, enabling synchronized views of auction progress.

### Auction Flow

1. **Setup:** Organizer creates a tournament, uploads players, and optionally creates teams dynamically.
2. **Auction Start:** Organizer starts the auction session; all bidders get notified.
3. **Bidding:** Bidders place bids on players; SignalR broadcasts each new bid to all participants.
4. **Player Sold:** Once bidding closes for a player, their status updates to SOLD and the information propagates to all clients instantly.
5. **Auction Pause/Finalize:** Organizer can pause or finalize the auction, controlling the flow and ending the session accordingly.
